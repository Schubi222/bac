Nearly all games can be split up into some form of parts, they my bear different titles, in most games they are either call levels, missions or quests. It is therefore that the level, mission or quest designers carry a very important role. They will have to create the ideas for the objects, characters and environment in a way that creates immersion for the player. If the setting of the level is based on historical events then the level designer might even have to travel to the places where they took place to make sure that what they create is accurate and realistic. If the game is based on a book or a film then it is the level designersâ€™ job to read the book or watch the movie to make sure they are versed in the lore.
