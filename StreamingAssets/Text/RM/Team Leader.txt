In almost every somewhat sizable project there will be team leaders for the different disciplines, so there will be a lead artist, a lead programmer and a lead designer. If a certain subcategory has a larger team there will most likely be a lead in some form. Their job is to oversee the rest of the team and communicate with the other teams and the producers. Depending on the size of the project the leader will be less involved in the task itself.
